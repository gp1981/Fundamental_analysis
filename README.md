# Fundamental Analysis for Value Investors

This repository contains R code to perform fundamental analysis for value investors. It leverages the `dplyr` and `tidyverse` libraries along with `fmpcloudr` to retrieve and analyze financial data from Financial Modeling Prep.

## Features

- **Ratio Analysis**: Analyze key financial ratios of a company.
- **Visualization**: Chart the cash ratio to visualize cash usage and sources.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare a companyâ€™s financial metrics with selected competitors.

## Requirements

- R (version >= 4.0.0)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)
- Packages: `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `fmpcloudr`, `ggplot2`, `shiny` (for interactive visualizations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fundamental_analysis.git
    cd fundamental_analysis
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyverse", "fmpcloudr", "ggplot2", "shiny"))
    ```

3. Set up your API Token:
    ```R
    library(fmpcloudr)
    fmpcloudr::fmpc_set_token('your_api_token')
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Analysis**:
    ```R
    source('scripts/run_analysis.R')
    ```

2. **Select the Company and Competitors**:
    Modify the `run_analysis.R` script to include the ticker of the company and its competitors.
